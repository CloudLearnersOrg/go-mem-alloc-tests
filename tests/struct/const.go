package structs

// Common constants for struct tests
const (
	// Number of objects to create for each test
	// This can be adjusted based on your system's memory capacity
	numObjects = 1000000 // 1 million objects

	// Smaller count for very large objects or low-memory environments
	numLargeObjects = 100000 // 100k objects
